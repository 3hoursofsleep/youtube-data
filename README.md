# Youtube Politics Dashboard

Static testing site for youtube politics dashboard, a tool created by The CSS Lab @ University of Pennsylvania. It gives detailed info on viewership and watch times on political videos, split into categories with examples over five years of data.

This github page will most likely be unfinished, as the final project will be moved to the Watts-Lab repo (CSS Lab repo):
